Hi! **python-file-manager** is a file manager (for windows) based on *Python 3.7*. It was made by [Aman Binjola](www.github.com/binjolaaman10) as a personal project. With this python based file explorer you can view files, folders and perform actions on them. Actions such as moving them, deleting them (permanently or sending them to recycle bin).

## Modules Used:

1. send2trash
2. os
3. shutil
4. sys

Python 3.7 or above is recommended for using this program.
You need to install *send2trash* module first. You can do this by using the following command:

> pip install send2trash

**send2trash** is a python module that sends files/folders to Recycle Bin instead of permanently deleting it.

## Functions you can perform on files/folders

 1. Delete files/folder permanently
 2. Send files/folder to Recycle Bin
 3. Directly open files from the manager
 4. Expand folders
 5. Move files/folders to another location
 6. Copy files/folders to another location
